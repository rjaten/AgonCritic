        Welcome to the very first edition Newsletter! <br>
        Normally, there will be information about new games that you can <br>
        see the ratings for and prizes for a random newsletter subscriber. <br>
        The real newsletter will look much better. I promise! <br>
        For now this will just be an update section for the website! <br><br>
            
        <h2 class="title">February Update!</h2><br>
        ----------------------------------------------------- <br>
        The site is live! Very little of the site is available. <br>
        If you click Games/Genre/Horror you can see a placeholder <br>
        for what it may look like when it's finished!
